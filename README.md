## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**


   git clone https://github.com/mohitkaninwal/ai-image-generator.git
   

2. **Install dependencies:**


   cd ai-image-generator
   npm install
  

3. **Configure OpenAI API key:**

   Obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform (https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `.env` file with your actual API key.

   
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY


4. **Start the development server:**

   
   npm start
  

   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Integrating OpenAI API into your React components is straightforward. Import the necessary components and functions from the `openai` module:


import { OpenAITextGenerator, OpenAIImageClassifier } from 'react-openai-api';

// Use OpenAITextGenerator component
<OpenAITextGenerator prompt="Write a creative sentence about" />

// Use OpenAIImageClassifier component
<OpenAIImageClassifier imageUrl="path/to/your/image.jpg" />


Customize the components according to your application's requirements.
